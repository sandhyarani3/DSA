#A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

if length is 1 then arr[0] is peak
if arr[0]>arr[1] then 0 also peak
if arr[n-1]>arr[n-2] then n-1 is peak
then perform BS 
if mid>mid-1 and mid>mid+1 this is peak
else if mid-1 is greater than mid then peak may on left
else if mid+1 is greater than mid then peak may on right
also possible for multiple peaks as we need to find any of peak
if mid-1>mid and mid+1>mid may goes infinite loop:
  to avoid loop
  instead of (else if mid+1 is greater than mid then peak may on right) using else if use else
